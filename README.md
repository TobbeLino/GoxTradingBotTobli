GoxTradingBot (Tobli version)
=============================

Gox Trading Bot Chrome Extension

This project is modified/enhanced version of the original Gox Trading Bot (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gox-trading-bot/iejmifigokhpcgpmoacllcdiceicmejb)

Enhanced features of this modified bot
--------------------------------------

 * Change sample intervals for the EMA calculations (5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours)
 
 * Decide when to trade after trend switch (1, 2 or 3 samples above thresholds)
 
 * Separate buy and sell thresholds
 
 * Trade in fiat currencies other than USD
 
 * Keep an amount of BTC away from trading
 
 * Detect and eliminate peaks/invalid samples from MtGox

 * Possibility to disable actual trading (the bot does everything, except the actual trading). Good for testing if e.g. a changed sample interval will cause a trend switch and would trigger an immediate trade.
 
 * Show chart with price and EMA-values
